## FXInternational WebFX Jobs Board Icon Fix

# Project Description
The FXInternational WebFX Jobs Board is a platform designed for browsing job listings. Currently, there is an issue where opening multiple job listings doesn't update the UI correctly, leading to confusion about the status of previously opened jobs.

# Issue Description

When multiple job listings are opened, the UI fails to update properly, resulting in misleading indicators for the status of opened jobs. For example:

The icon indicating an opened job remains as if the job is still open, even after navigating to another job.
The toggle icon (+/-) for expanding/collapsing job descriptions may not update correctly when multiple job listings are opened simultaneously.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance the functionality of the FXInternational WebFX Jobs Board by ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the status of opened job listings. This includes updating icons and indicators appropriately when navigating between job listings.
